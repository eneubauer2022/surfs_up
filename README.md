# surfs_up
## Overview

A famous surfer, W.Avy, has asked for an analysis to understand the impact of of weather conditions before deciding if he wants to open a surf and Ice Cream Shop in Oahu, Hawaii. 

## Software and Resources
 
- SQLlite
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results:

### December Statistics

The mean temperature for June (75*) is slightly higher than December (71*).
There was also an increased chance of precipitation in December (0.22") compared to January (0.14").

When we increase our sample size of data to include a month before June and a month after - we see that the temperatures stay pretty consistent.

If we apply the same methodology to December (a month before the data and a month after) - again we see very consistent data with not much variance.

## Summary
Even though the numbers were slightly different between the months of June and December - the variance between temperature and precipitation was not much. Even comparing the same metric across the additional months of May - July and November - January, it seems reasonable to assume that opening a shop in this location would be ideal.
